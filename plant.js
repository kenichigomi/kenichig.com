    Will have a plant that will need to be watered depending on daily weather conditions

    Water Mechanics
    - If a plant is not watered for 7 days, the plant will die
    - The amount of water a plant needs per day depends on the age of the plant
    - If a plant recieves more than 3 times the amount of water needed, the plant will drown
    
    Weather Mechanics
    - If the weather is sunny, the plant will need 1.5 times the amount of water
    - If the weather is cloudy, the plant will need 1 times the amount of water
    - If the weather is rainy, the plant will not need water

    Rewards
    - If a plant has been watered for 1 month, the plant will play a rick roll
