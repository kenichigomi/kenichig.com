    Will have a plant that will need to be watered depending on daily weather conditions
    Plant will die after 1 week of no water
    Plant will die after too much watering (3 times max per day)
    Water depletes at a rate of 1 unit per day, therefore you can water for 3 days worth at once
    Plant will die randomly of disease
    Plant will play a rick roll after 50 days of constant watering
    Plant will have a status message that explains the general status of the plant
    We are number 1 after 100 days
    Megalovania after 200 days
